Beginning with Open MQ 4.4u2, Oracle no longer offers Open MQ as an independent product. 
Open MQ will continue to provide builds and separate release packages as they are contributing to the GlassFish Server project. 
Support contracts continue to be offered as part of GlassFish Enterprise Server 
and customers may use GlassFish MQ as a component of the Java EE server. 
Existing MQ customers should discuss the appropriate options, with their support sales representative. 
JMS Development will continue as a component of GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 
and as a component to Oracle GlassFish Enterprise Server. 
Installer guide for stand-alone MQ will no longer be updated. 
We will provide the Open MQ community updates and errata changes, using the Open MQ Wiki, here.

Open MQ 4.5 community documentation collection is contained within the GlassFish Server 3.1 Documentation Collection.
