			Functional Specification
</center></H2>

<P>
[Remove bracketed text when completing this functional specification]
<P>
[The functional specification is the blueprint that the implementation will
 be based on, the basis for the documentation and it will contain key
 material that will be used during the ARC review.  This spec should describe
 what the feature is, how it will work and how it fits into the rest of
 the product.  The details are important.  Someone interested in how an
 external part of a feature will work should be able to read the functional
 spec and find that information.]
<DL>
      <P><DT><b>1.0 Author/Date:</b>
<DD>
	[A. Developer 11/20/2002]

      <P><DT><b>2.0 Synopsis:</b><DD>
	[One sentence synopsis of the work to be performed.  Can be copied
	 from the existing one-pager]

<P><DT><b>3.0 PRD Requirement #:</b><DD>
	[Requirement # from the Product Requirements Document for the
         requirement this feature helps to address]

<P><DT><b>4.0 Description:</b><DD>
	[A precise description of the work to be implemented.  Give details.
	 This can also be copied from the one-pager but it should only
	 describe the aspects of the feature that will be implemented in
	 this release and will likely require more detail than what was
	 provided in the one-pager.  Use this section to describe what it 
	 is and how it will work.  Describe it from a functional point of 
	 view. If someone wants to know the details of the feature this is 
	 where they will find the information.]

<P><DT><b>5.0 Non-feature:</b><DD>
	[If there is some aspect of this feature that you are not implementing
	 that a reasonable person might normally expect to find in the feature
	 list it here.]

<P><DT><b>6.0 Dependencies:</b><DD>
	[List all (technology) dependencies this work has.  What impact will
	 it have on other groups?  Can be copied from the one-pager.]

<P><DT><b>7.0 Interfaces:</b><DD>
	[Create a table that lists the imported and exported interfaces this
	 feature consumes or produces.  For each exported interface you
	 should assign a stability classification as defined in the
	 <A href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/arc/policies/interface-taxonomy/">
	 Interface Taxonomy</a>
<P>
	 Interfaces include API, protocols, jar files, config files, CLI's
	 (command names, options and output), GUI's, port numbers, etc.  As 
	 an example take a look at the interface table in the 
	 <A href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/arc/caselog/2008/648/proposal-html/">
	 Proposal submission for MQ 4.3 (ARC case 2008/648) </a>.
<P>
	 This information is required prior to our ARC review. You can see a sample ARC document <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/arc/caselog/2008/648/">here</a> ]

<P><DT><b>8.0 Performance:</b><DD>
	[If this feature has performance implications or requirements, 
	 describe them here.  What are the performance goals and how will
	 performance be measured.  Are there risks to the product's 
	 performance introduced because of this feature?  Think about
	 performance from both a throughput and scalability point of view.]

<P><DT><b>9.0 Configuration/Administration:</b><DD>
	[Describe how this feature can be configured.  For example if 
	 new properties are being introduced list the property name, 
	 its default value, what it controls and where the property can 
	 be set.  What are the specific changes to the administration tools 
	 to support this feature?]

<P><DT><b>10.0 Instrumentation/Diagnostics:</b><DD>
	[How will the feature be monitored?  How will a user know when the
	 feature is not operating normally?  What will be available to 
	 Customer Support to help diagnose problems related to this feature?
	 Describe how the feature will use logging, stderr, syslog and
	 other debugging options.

<P><DT><b>11.0 Compatibility/Interoperability/Migration:</b><DD>
	[Will the implementation of this feature require the migration of
	 existing user's data?  How will this be accomplished?  Are there
	 compatibility and/or interoperability issues introduced by this
	 feature (Will this feature work with an older version of the 
	 product)?  Do the compatibility/interoperability issues need 
	 to be mitigated?  How?]

<P><DT><b>12.0 Security:</b><DD>
	[Does this feature impact the security of the product? What are
	 the security implications of this feature?  If the feature 
	 interacts directly with any security-related APIs or interfaces, 
	 make a note here. If the feature expects to have any Java 
	 policy or platform user/permissions implications, note them here.
	 If the feature exposes any new ports, listeners, or any similar 
	 communication points which may have security implications, note 
	 these here.  This information may be copied from the one-pager]

<P><DT><b>13.0 Standards Conformance:</b><DD>
	[Is there any particular standard that this feature is implementing?
	 e.g. JMS 1.1, SAAJ 1.2]

<P><DT><b>14.0 Installation/packaging:</b><DD>
	[Describe how this feature effects the installation, removal or
	 packaging of the product.  If there are specific changes required 
	 to the installer due to this feature list those changes here.  May 
	 be copied from the one-pager.]

<P><DT><b>15.0 Use Cases:</b><DD>
	[A use case defines a single task, performed by the user of a system,
	 that has some useful outcome.  As defined in the UML Specification 
	 v1.3: ``You apply use cases to capture the intended behavior of the 
	 system you are developing, without having to specify how that 
	 behavior is implemented. Use cases provide a way for your developers
	 to come to a common understanding with your system's end users and 
	 domain experts. In addition, use cases serve to help validate your
	 architecture and to verify your system as it evolves during 
	 development.''] 

<P><DT><b>16.0 Other:</b><DD>
	[List other useful information about this feature here.  If this
	 feature impacts another part of the product make a note of it here.]

<P><DT><b>17.0 Documentation:</b><DD>
        [List your expected impact on each book listed in the table below.
         For example: "New chapter to describe HA clusters",
                      "Minor updates to imqdbmgr options", etc.
         Also include in this section any additional information that you
         feel would be useful to the writers that does not appear elsewhere
         in this document.]
