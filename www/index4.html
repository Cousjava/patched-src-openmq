<p>Open Message Queue (Open MQ) is a product that implements and facilitates message transfer between applications. The Open MQ <em>project</em>  is the ongoing development of features, functions, ideas, and patterns that are useful for Open MQ, and sometimes similar products. This is a community of developers and users who have a shared interest in this product, or products and technologies like this. The Open Message Queue product is the community version of Sun Java System Message Queue. Complete downloads are available for Solaris Sparc, Solaris x86, Linux, and Windows, and we supply a Java only package for use on other platforms (such as Macintosh and AIX). The Open Message Queue Source code for the project is available as a single .zip archive file.</p>
<p>The product Open MQ provides a convenient way to connect your applications together so that they can run independently from each other. Open MQ can be used as a buffer between applications that can produce and consume messages and different rates. Open MQ can also distribute messages in a prescribed way. This is flexible and can be changed without impacting the applications that are sending or receiving messages. Open MQ implements a variety of message delivery patterns that allow it to be customized to meet a wide variety of requirements involving speed, buffer storage, resiliency, and stability and independence. <a href="features.html">Here's a feature matrix ...</a> </p>

<ul>
  <li>We are pleased to introduce UMS -- an extremely simple Web Client API for accessing JMS. There are two access methods for this new interface: You can use XML Documents or URL query strings to access the JMS destinations via  HTTP or HTTPS. Read more about this, at the <a href="4.3-content/ums/umsMain.html">UMS feature description page</a>. </li>
  <li>We have introduced new install bundles which include an Open Installer UI. This provides a UI for the community installs. Other features include: Product Registration, unattended install and configuration, and text only install (Unix only). You can download these, from this <a href="4.3.html#download">link</a>. </li>
