<P><DT><b>Synopsis: </b><DD>
	[One sentence synopsis of the work to be performed]

<P><DT><b>Quick Questions:</b><DD>
<UL><LI>Difficulity: [Easy|Medium|Hard]</LI>
    </UL>

<P><DT><b>Description:</b><DD>
	[A longer description of the work to be implemented.  Give details]

<P><DT><b>Requestor:</b><DD>
	[Is there a customer or someone internal to Sun requesting
	 this feature?  If so, identify the group(s).]

<P><DT><b>Non-feature:</b><DD>
	[A description of aspects of the work that will *not* be implemented]

<P><DT><b>Dependencies:</b><DD>
	[List all (technology) dependencies this work has.  What impact will
	 it have on other groups?]

<P><DT><b>Competitive Analysis:</b><DD>
	[Which competitors have this feature?  How is this feature the
	same and how is this feature different from what our competitors
	offer?]

<P><DT><b>Phases:</b><DD>
	[Can this work be broken into phases that are implemented at
	 different times?  What would each phase include?  The phase can
	 be across a single product release or multiple product releases.]

<P><DT><b>Direction of Implementation:</b><DD>
	[How will the implementation be done?  Will we buy/license other
	 technology?  From whom?  Can the implementation of a phase be 
	 shared by multiple developers?]

<P><DT><b>Cost:</b><DD>
	[How many engineering man/weeks will the implementation take? 
	 Be sure to consider the time to do the implementation, write
	 test cases and provide doc and support input for this work.
	 Please list the cost to implement the feature separate from 
	 the cost to write the tests.  Since those items can be done 
	 by different people the cost estimates need to be broken 
	 down separately.  When you develop the cost estimate use a 
	 loaded cost.  That means if you say one week and you start on 
	 Monday you should be finished on Friday.  In other words that 
	 one week includes the time you may spend reading mail, 
	 eating lunch, attending meetings.  Don't factor in vacations
	 or holidays.
<pre>

	 e.g:

	 Phase 1: 

	    Broker		: 3 weeks
	    Broker Test	Dev	: 1 week
	    Client		: 1 week
	    Client Test	Dev	: 0
	    Admin		: 2 days
	    Admin Test Dev	: 1 day
            Doc			: 1 week
            Support Training	: 3 days

	 Phase 2: 

	    Broker		: 1 week
	    Broker Test		: 1 week
            Doc			: 3 days
            Support Training	: 3 days
</pre>
         ]

<P><DT><b>Interfaces:</b><DD>
	[Will this work need to be reviewed by the ARC?  Does it introduce
	 new interfaces (GUI, config, API, etc), modify or delete existing 
	 interfaces?]

<P><DT><b>Test Impact:</b><DD>
	[How hard will it be to test this work?  Can it be completely
	 tested through automated tests or will manual tests be required 
	 as well?  If both what percent are manual?]

<P><DT><b>Doc Impact:</b><DD>
	[Is the item an addition/expansion of an existing feature (or command 
	 set) or is it a new feature?
	 Does it affect the Admin GUI?
	 In your opinion how many pages of doc are required to adequately 
	 cover this feature?
	 Is it principally a feature for development or administration? C dev? 
	 Java dev?
	 Does it introduce new concepts? Which?
	 If the feature is a new feature, should it be documented in a 
	 separate doc or as part of our existing doc set?
	 Any additional questions/issues you can think of?]

<P><DT><b>Support Impact:</b><DD>
	[How will this work impact the supportability of the product?
	 Will the product be easier to support or more difficult to support
	 after this work is completed?  For example Certificate management
	 create a lot of support issues in JWS.  Will it be necessary to
	 provide additional support training if this work is completed?]

<P><DT><b>Installation Impact:</b><DD>
	[Will this work effect installation?  How?]

<P><DT><b>Admin/Config Impact:</b><DD>
	[How will this work impact the administration and configuration
	 of the product? The cost estimate above should include this cost
	 or reference another one pager.
	 Include a one line description summary of possible admin tool
	 impact e.g.
 	    imqobjmgr: new admin obj attrs
 	    imqobjmgr: new admin obj
 	    imqobjmgr: enhancements
 	    imqcmd: new attributes for existing subcommands
 	    imqcmd: new subcommand
 	    imqcmd: enhancements
 	    imqusermgr: enhancements
 	    new admin tool
	]

<P><DT><b>I18N/L10N Impact:</b><DD>
	[Does this work need to be internationalized?  Beyond string
	 localization are there other I18N/L10N issues?]  

<P><DT><b>Security Impact:</b><DD>
        [If the new feature interacts directly with any security-related
         APIs or interfaces, make a note here. If the new feature expects
         to have any Java policy or platform user/permissions implications,
         note them here. If the feature exposes any new ports, listeners,
         or any similar communication points which may have security
         implications, note these here.]

<P><DT><b>Risks:</b><DD>
	[What are the risks?  E.g. Difficult to do correctly.  Highly 
	 dependent on 3rd party.  Not easy to test. etc.

<P><DT><b>See Also:</b><DD>
	[List any references that may be valuable to the reader. These could
	 be URLs to specifications, references to other New Work Analysis,
	 etc.]
