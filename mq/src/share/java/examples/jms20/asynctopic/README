asynctopic example
-------------------

Description
-----------
This example illustrates how to write an application that uses a
JMS2.0 simplified API to send messages and asynchronously receive messages  
to/from topic. It also illustrates the use of jdk7 feature try-with-resources in JMS application.

Files
-----
AsyncTopicConsumer.java           Source file for this example.
SendMsgsToTopic.java              Source file for this example.

Configuring the environment
---------------------------
To recompile or run this example, you need to set CLASSPATH
to include at least:
    jms.jar
    imq.jar
    directory containing this example

A detailed guideline on configuring your enrivonment and setting CLASSPATH
is found in the top-level README file of the examples (demo) directory of
the Message Queue installation (<IMQ_HOME>/examples/README) as well as in
the "Quick Start Tutorial" in the Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue
Developer's Guide.

Building the example
--------------------
Run the following:

    javac AsyncTopicConsumer.java
    javac SendMsgsToTopic.java

Running the example
-------------------

Start a broker

   imqbrokerd -tty

Run the following command first on one terminal:

   java AsyncTopicConsumer <topic_name> [<number_of_messages>]

Run the following command on another terminal:

   java SendMsgsToTopic <topic_name> [<number_of_messages>]
  

The output of AsyncTopicConsumer looks like this:

java AsyncTopicConsumer topic1 5

Topic name is topic1
Created jms context successfully
Created topic successfully
Message Received :Here is a message 1
Message Received :Here is a message 2
Message Received :Here is a message 3
Message Received :Here is a message 4
Message Received :Here is a message 5

The output of SendMsgsToTopic looks like this:

java SendMsgsToTopic topic1 5

Topic name is topic1
Created jms context successfully
Created topic successfully
Sending message: Here is a message 1
Sending message: Here is a message 2
Sending message: Here is a message 3
